        <h1>Google Fastbutton. Zero config.<small>Also, working.</small></h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Most any Mobile Web Developer has heard of Google's seminal "Fastbutton" paper
        <a href='https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons'>
          https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper are detailed ways to make websites act and feel
        as responsive as native apps -
        <br />
        a critical issue in the fight for the open web.
      </p>
      <h3>A bit of history</h3>
      <p>
        Due to several questionable design decisions,
        the client-side speed of the mobile web was crippled.
        <br />
        No matter how skilled, developers could never hope to achieve
        the same speed as native mobile apps -
        <br />
        Simulating "clicks" was artificially and purposefully delayed,
        much to the annoyance of the user.
        <br />
        "The Google Paper" mostly solved this problem.
        <br />
        Mostly.
      </p>
      <h3>The current state of the art.</h3>
      <p>
        The following project
        <br />
        <a href='https://github.com/alexblack/google-fastbutton'>
          https://github.com/alexblack/google-fastbutton
        </a>
        <br />
        is an almost-exact copy of the Google code. In jQuery, the "fastclick"
        event is exposed and it can be used as a normal jQuery event.
        <br />
        It works well enough but has the following problems:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It requires that every "clicked" object be initialized separately.
            If you ever forget one - tough luck.
          </li>
          <li>
            It cannot be used with <em>$.fn.live</em>.
            In fact, when used that way it breaks every single non-"fastclick"
            button or link on the page without notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            It doesn't setup any useful defaults.
            Not only does every link have to be setup separately,
            but <em>every</em> link has to be setup separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            It sets up a different event listener for every element.
            On a site with hundreds of clickable links, this is undesirable.
            Yeah, event listeners are cheap but come on.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Enter jQuery-fastbutton</h2>
      <p>
        jQuery-fastbutton simplifies all this.
      </p>
      <h3>Zero-config usage</h3>
      <p>
        Just include this script:
        <br />
        TODO: SCRIPT URL HERE
        <br />
        This will do the following things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            All links will be fast-clickable.
            <br />
            <pre>&lt;a href='http://www.google.com'&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            All links that open in a new tab will be fast-clickable.
            <br />
            <pre>&lt;a href='http://www.google.com' target='_blank'&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Text input fields will be fast-selectable.
            <br />
            <pre>&lt;input type='text' placeholder='click me'/&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Forms will be fast-submittable.
            (standard caveats apply)
            <pre>&lt;input type='submit' value='submit me'/&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            All links that have the "fastClick" class will be fast-clickable.
            <br />
            <pre>&lt;a class="fastClick"&gt;I have a JS handler&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            All links that follow the Rails "data-remote" convention will be fast-clickable.
            <br />
            <pre>&lt;a data-remote='true'&gt;I have a JS handler, too&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes both currently present and future links/inputs/submits
      </p>
      <h3>Customizable Usage</h3>
      <p>
        Do this:
        <pre>$('a').fastButton(function(event) {&#x000A;  alert("Now you're clicking with gas");&#x000A;})</pre>
        Every place where you would normally write
        <code>$('...').live('click', ...)</code>,
        you can also write
        <code>$('...').fastButton('click', ...)</code>
        Internally, jQuery-fastButton uses <code>$.fn.live</code>, so every place
        where you could <em>not</em> use <code>$('...').live</code>,
        you also won't be able to use <code>$('...').fastButton</code>
      </p>
      <h3>Bookmark</h3>
      <p>
        If you so desire, you can instantly fastclick-ify any webpage by clicking on a bookmark.
        TODO: BOOKMARK HERE
