      %p
        Most any Mobile Web Developer has heard of Google's seminal "Fastbutton" paper
        %a{ href: 'https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons' }
          https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons
      %p
        In this paper are detailed ways to make websites act and feel
        as responsive as native apps - 
        %br
        a critical issue in the fight for the open web.

      %h3 A bit of history
      %p
        Due to several questionable design decisions,
        the client-side speed of the mobile web was crippled.
        %br
        No matter how skilled, developers could never hope to achieve
        the same speed as native mobile apps - 
        %br
        Simulating "clicks" was artificially and purposefully delayed,
        much to the annoyance of the user.
        %br
        "The Google Paper" mostly solved this problem.
        %br
        Mostly.

      %h3 The current state of the art.
      %p
        The following project
        %br
        %a{ href: 'https://github.com/alexblack/google-fastbutton' }
          https://github.com/alexblack/google-fastbutton
        %br
        is an almost-exact copy of the Google code. In jQuery, the "fastclick"
        event is exposed and it can be used as a normal jQuery event.
        %br
        It works well enough but has the following problems:
        %ul
          %li
            It requires that every "clicked" object be initialized separately.
            If you ever forget one - tough luck.
          %li
            It cannot be used with <em>$.fn.live</em>.
            In fact, when used that way it breaks every single non-"fastclick"
            button or link on the page without notice.
          %li
            It doesn't provide any useful defaults.
            Not only does every link have to be setup separately,
            but every type of link has to be setup manually.
          %li
            It sets up a different event listener for every element.
            On a site with hundreds of clickable links, this is undesirable.
            Yeah, RAM is cheap but come on.
      %h2 Enter <a href='https://github.com/x1024/jquery-fastbutton'>jQuery-fastbutton</a>
      %p <a href='https://github.com/x1024/jquery-fastbutton'>jQuery-fastbutton</a> simplifies all this.
      %p
        It provides decent defaults,
        is initialized only once and
        handles both currently existing and future links.
        Also, it has fewer event listeners.

      %h3 Zero-config usage
      %p
        Just include this script:
        %br
        %pre
          :plain
            &lt;script src='https://raw.github.com/x1024/jquery-fastbutton/master/bin/fastbutton.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        %br

        %p This will do the following things:
        %ul
          %li
            All links will be fast-clickable.
            %br
            %pre &lt;a href='http://www.google.com'&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
          %li
            All links that open in a new tab will be fast-clickable.
            %br
            %pre &lt;a href='http://www.google.com' target='_blank'&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
          %li
            Text input fields will be fast-selectable.
            %br
            %pre &lt;input type='text' placeholder='click me'/&gt;
          %li
            Forms will be fast-submittable.
            (standard caveats apply)
            %pre &lt;input type='submit' value='submit me'/&gt;
          %li
            All links that have the "fastClick" class will be fast-clickable.
            %br
            %pre &lt;a class="fastClick"&gt;I have a JS handler&lt;/a&gt;
          %li
            All links that follow the Rails "data-remote" convention will be fast-clickable.
            %br
            %pre &lt;a data-remote='true'&gt;I have a JS handler, too&lt;/a&gt;

      %p
        This includes both currently present and future links/inputs/submits
      %p
        Additionally, you can customize the https://github.com/x1024/jquery-fastbutton

      %h3 Customizable Usage
      %p
        Do this:
        :plain
          <pre>$('a').fastButton(function(event) {
            alert("Now you're clicking with gas");
          })</pre>
      %p
        Every place where you would normally write
        <code>$('...').live('click', ...)</code>,
        you can also write
        <code>$('...').fastButton('click', ...)</code>
      %p
        Internally, <a href='https://github.com/x1024/jquery-fastbutton'>jQuery-fastButton</a> uses <code>$.fn.live</code> so any place
        where you could <em>not</em> use <code>$('...').live</code>,
        you also won't be able to use <code>$('...').fastButton</code>

      %h3 Bookmark
      %p
        If you so desire, you can instantly fastclick-ify any webpage.
        %a{ href: @bookmarklet } Just use this bookmarklet.
        %pre= @bookmarklet
